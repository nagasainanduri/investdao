# InvestmentDAO 🚀

> A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) for community-driven investment decisions built on the Aptos blockchain

## 📋 Project Description

InvestmentDAO is a cutting-edge decentralized investment platform that empowers communities to make collective investment decisions through transparent, democratic governance. Built on the Aptos blockchain using Move smart contracts, it combines the security of blockchain technology with the power of community-driven decision making.

The platform enables members to propose investment opportunities, vote on proposals using governance tokens, and automatically execute approved investments through smart contracts. Every decision is transparent, immutable, and driven by community consensus.
